Hi, my name is Rodolfo Peinado Guerrero. I'm a Senior Full Stack Engineer with over 9 years of experience designing and building high-performance, scalable web applications across multiple industries, including EdTech, healthcare, and finance.

I specialize in both front-end and back-end development using modern stacks like React, Next.js, Vue, and Angular on the front end, and Python, Django, Node.js, and Golang on the back end. I've also worked extensively with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure, handling everything from CI/CD automation to microservices orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.

In my recent role, I led the migration of a legacy Python system to Go, significantly improving system performance and scalability. I've also delivered several AI-driven products using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and tools like Langchain and Pinecone, helping reduce deployment cycles and increase automation.

Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring junior developers, fostering collaboration in Agile teams, and continuously learning new technologies. I'm passionate about building maintainable architectures that not only solve today's problems but scale for tomorrow.

I'm excited to be here and look forward to contributing my experience and learning from the team as well.
