Thanks for having me today. I’m Kayky, a senior full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience building scalable, user-friendly applications. I work across front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, and backend technologies including Node.js, Python, Django, and .NET. What I really enjoy is taking complex requirements and turning them into simple, responsive applications that perform well and provide a great user experience.

Most recently, I was at Avantsoft, where I worked extensively with React, Vue 3, and Nuxt 3. I helped design responsive interfaces, developed backend services with Node.js and Python, implemented secure APIs, and optimized databases using PostgreSQL and Redis. I also contributed to enterprise-level applications that required high performance and reliability.

Before that, at NGX Interactive, I focused on healthcare solutions. I built reusable React and Angular components, integrated payment and scheduling systems, and set up CI/CD pipelines with Docker to make deployments smoother and more efficient. Working on healthcare applications was particularly rewarding because the work directly impacted users’ lives, which motivated me to focus on usability and reliability.

Beyond the technical side, I really enjoy mentoring junior developers, collaborating with designers and product teams, and making sure projects are delivered on time while maintaining a strong user experience. Right now, I’m looking for a role where I can bring this mix of technical expertise, problem-solving, and teamwork to build impactful products and continue growing as a senior developer.
